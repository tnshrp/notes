If I come across an app that attempts to solve a problem I care for, my first instinct is to skim through the list of screenshots, its feature-list and give it a spin without spending too much time on it. This is regardless of the fact that I may already have an app for the same job. My hope is to discover a significantly better way to do the same thing or discover an unserved need I didn't know existed. For example, I've lost the count of the number of apps I've tried so far, looking for that perfect Evernote alternative. That search is still on.
### The Switch

On one such occasion, I came across [Sync for Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync&hl=en) (we'll shorten it to "Sync") which is one of the many mobile apps for accessing Reddit, a social content-sharing/opinions site. I was using [Reddit is Fun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.redditdonation) (let's call it RIF) until then. One look, and I was instantly prepared to switch to Sync for Reddit. Accessing comments on a Reddit thread 'felt' easier because it look a tap less and one had more real estate to tap on. 

Really? That's the reason? 

Yes. While it may sound trivial, deeper introspection led me to a very important learning: `the importance of knowing exactly what your user is using your product for.`

### The details

Reddit is a social network built around your interests ranging from [World News](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/) and [Indian Food](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/) to pictures of a random dude sleeping. (Really. it exists: [Pictures of Ian Sleeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/picturesofiansleeping)). You subscribe to corresponding communities (called subreddits) where members share and comment on relevant content and hold discussions. 

On RIF, one can access comments after two taps:

1) Tap on the topic
2) Tap on the "comments"
3) Read the discussion

On Sync, I can directly go to the comments:  
1) Tap on the large grey box around the title
2) Read the discussion
